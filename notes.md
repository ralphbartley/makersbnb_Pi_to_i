## Day 1

### Morning

* Following chat from Eoin, jumped on zoom call and determined the goals for the day using a Trello board.

* Day 1 goals are:
- To go through the specification and determine user stories
- Determine the MVP
- Create domain models

### Afternoon

- Zoom call to discuss the user stories:
  * Didn't assign roles at this point
  * Spoke through the specifications as a group
  * Discussion over whether to distinguish between renters/rentees
  * Ralph and David made point that for MVP at this point it didn't make sense to distinguish
